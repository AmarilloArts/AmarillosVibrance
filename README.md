# Amarillo's Vibrance

What is this?
=============
A Blender addon that adds a Compositor Node Group called Amarillo's Vibrance. It tries to emulate Photoshop's Vibrance adjustment while adding a little extra on top.

**Amarillo's Vibrance:**

The difference with "Unprocessed colors" is subtle, but huge in the proper context. Here the skin tones look richer, while leaving the stronger colors less affected - or not at all.

**Vibrance**

This is the emulation of Photoshop's Vibrance. It differs from Saturation as it boosts desaturated colors while leaving the more saturated ones. Regular saturation boosts indiscriminately, which produces darker and/or overblown colors in some cases.

**Saturation Boost**

This value lets you play with the falloff of the vibrance. 0 means regular Vibrance. 1 means an extra boosted vibrance that affects the saturated colors as well. Even with a Saturation Boost of 1, this Node Group produces a more visually pleasing look than pure Saturation. At least to my personal taste.

**Fac**

Your typical Blender "Fac" parameter that controls how much this node affets the mix. 0 means no Vibrance added at all (which is the same as not using this node). 1 means full effect.

Wow you must be a genious!!

Thank ChatGPT, not me. I won't take real "credit" for this. I just sat with the good ol' Yippity for an hour or two.
